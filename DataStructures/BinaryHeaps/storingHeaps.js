//Can use an array to store binary heap or a tree class, arrya is simplier


//Since we are dealing with Binary Heap, 
    //First number in an array is the root
        //next two are the left and right respectively
    //Second number is the next parent
        //It's children are 3/4 we skipped over 2 because that is a parent at the second level
        //after the first parent, notice we are leap frogging skipping 1 and grabbing the next two
            //if you have a parent, its children are at 2n+1 and 2n+2 for the left and right child respectively
    //If you have a child and want the parent we need to do..
        //n-1/2 
            //have to floor
