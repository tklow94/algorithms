//converts keys into valid array indices.
//allows us to pass in data of any size, and receive an output of a fixed size, meaning the size of the data output no matter the size of the input is the same.
    //"hello" => 12
    //"Trevor is the best" => 13

//a good hash function is fast, constant time O(1)
//Distributes keys uniformly, meaning random assignment amd/or evenly spread.
//Same input results in the same output everytime. It is deterministic.
