//Hash table is used to store key value pairs, but not ordered. Fast for finding, adding, removing values. Don't have to search through the entire data set to do these compare to an array.


//take an input key and convert it into a valid array indices. This is how we are able to lookup values by key if we have an index assigned to that key.
    //hash functions help us do this.
    //EX: at index 0, we could have ["pink", "#ff69b4"]
