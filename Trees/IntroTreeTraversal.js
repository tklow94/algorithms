//how do we visit every node once in a tree?
    //uses recursion!
    //Going over BFS and DFS (in order, post and pre order)

//time complexity is the same for all b. visits all nodes. (O(n))

//BFS
    //space complexity could be musch larger on a large tree b.c it stores all nodes ina  queue

//DFS
    //better for larger (wider) data sets in terms of space complexity.
    //Worse for super long one sided trees.



//DFPre
    //Useful for duplicating or storing a tree



//DFPost
    //Sorry nothing here baby



//DFInOrder
    //Used with BST b.c get them in order
